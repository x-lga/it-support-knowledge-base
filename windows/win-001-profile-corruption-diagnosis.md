## What This Article Covers

Windows user profile corruption is one of the most mishandled L1 tickets.
The symptom ("I can't log in" or "my desktop is blank") is identical to a dozen
other issues, so the first failure mode is treating it as a password or lockout
issue and wasting 20 minutes on AD before discovering the profile is the problem.
The second failure mode is deleting the profile without verifying data can be
recovered. This article prevents both.

A corrupted profile typically manifests as one of three presentations:
1. User logs in and gets a temporary profile ("You have been signed in with a
   temporary profile" notification in the bottom right)
2. User logs in but desktop, Start menu, and taskbar are all blank or missing
3. User cannot log in at all - login fails with "The User Profile Service failed
   the sign-in" error even with correct credentials
